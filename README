Description
===========

This is the P600FW project, a CPU/firmware remake for the SCI Prophet 600 (http://www.vintagesynth.com/sci/p600.php).
It uses a slightly modified Teensy++ board (http://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp_pins.html) that plugs into the Z80 socket.

Installation and usage

History
=======
- all revisions based on Gligli V2.1 RC3
- V2.20 JS - added noise mod and new LFO waveforms step8, seq, RevSaw
- V2.21 JS - added new LFO waveforms step4
- V2.22 JS - added 4bit Triangle and 6bit Sine
- V2.23 JS - fixed patch compatibility bug introduced in V 2.22
- V2.24 JS - reverted polymod bug to RC1 behavior 
- V2.25 JS - added new vibrato waveforms and Vibrato targets
- V2.26B JS - fixed post “Tune” volume bug introduced in V2.25
- V2.28 JS - added polymod VCO A, VCO B, VCO A-B targets

V2.25 includes -
LFO has 6 new waveforms:
Step8, RevSaw, Seq, Step4, Bit_Tri, Bit_Sine
New Pitch Bender targets:PW(VCO A), and VCO B only 

New noise source setting control. Pressing "to tape" 0 a second time lets you adjust the VCF CV input level and store it with a patch. I modified my P600 to add a noise source and use this parameter to adjust the noise source per patch, hence in the UI this displays as "noise". However, in an unmodified Prophet 600, this parameter controls the VCF CV input level.

Vibrato now has: 1) all LFO waveforms (CC74), 2) high and low range (CC75), and 3) target AB, A, B, VCA and Noise level (CC76)

Added channel aftertouch (e.g., channel pressure). If you use an external controller that has aftertouch controlling the Prophet 600, the Prophet 600 now uses this MIDI channel aftertouch data to modulate whatever the Mod-wheel is modulating. For example, I used it to apply vibrato to notes.

Added Poly-Aftertouch (e.g., per note)

Also added are:
CC7 Volume 
CC120 (All sound off)
CC123 (All notes off)

To use vibrato waveforms "to tape" + 1 three times

To use vibrato range "to tape" + 2 three times

To use vibrato targets "to tape" + 3 three times
